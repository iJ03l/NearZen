**Open-source framework for establishing and scaling regional NEAR hubs globally, with transparent tools, open contributions, and ecosystem funding pathways.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

- **Clone repo**: `git clone https://github.com/iJ03l/NearZen.git`
- **Install dependencies**: `pnpm install`
- **Start building**: Check out `/templates` for hub starter kits
- **Run tests**: `pnpm test`
- **Use the Funding SDK**: See usage below for submitting DAO proposals

## ‚ú® Features

- üåç **Global Accessibility**: Start a NEAR hub anywhere with our standing kit
- üîß **Modular Tools**: Templates for DAOs, events, governance, and community building
- üí∞ **Funding Pathway**: Built-in mechanisms for established communities to request ecosystem funding
- ü§ù **Open Contributions**: Anyone can contribute improvements, translations, and regional adaptations
- üìä **Metrics & Analytics**: Track your hub's performance and impact transparently
- üîó **NEAR Integration**: Seamless compatibility with NEAR wallets, DAOs, and protocols

### ‚ú® Implemented Features

- **Funding Module SDK**: A TypeScript library for submitting funding proposals to NEAR DAOs with wallet integration.
- **Basic Repo Structure**: Folders for packages, templates, examples, scripts, tests, and CI workflows.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Automated linting and testing on pushes/PRs.
- **Testing with Jest**: Unit tests for the SDK, including mocks for wallet and network calls.

## üåü Getting Started

### For Hub Organizers
1. **Download the Standing Kit**: Visit our [documentation](docs/) for step-by-step guides
2. **Customize Templates**: Adapt governance structures and event plans for your region
3. **Launch Your Hub**: Use our proof-of-concept tools to validate your approach
4. **Track Progress**: Implement our metrics dashboard to measure impact

### For Contributors
1. **Read Contributing Guidelines**: Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for PR guidelines
2. **Pick an Issue**: Look for `good-first-issue` labels in our [Issues](https://github.com/iJ03l/NearZen/issues)
3. **Join Discussions**: Participate in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/iJ03l/NearZen/discussions)
4. **Share Your Experience**: Submit case studies from your regional implementations

### For Funding Requests
1. **Prove Impact**: Document your hub's activities and community engagement
2. **Use Our Templates**: Follow standardized proposal formats in `/templates/funding-proposal.md`
3. **Submit Through DAO**: Community-driven review process ensures transparency
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor your request status through our dashboard

## üîß Development

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/iJ03l/NearZen.git

cd NearZen

Install dependencies

pnpm install
Run linting

pnpm run lint
Run tests

pnpm test
Build (if needed)

tsc # Compiles TS to JS in /dist


## üí∞ Using the Funding SDK

The SDK allows established NearZen hubs to submit funding proposals to a NEAR DAO.

### Installation
Copy `/packages/funding-sdk` into your project or install dependencies:

> pnpm add @near-wallet-selector/core @near-wallet-selector/modal-ui @near-wallet-selector/near-wallet @near-wallet-selector/here-wallet near-api-js

### Example Usage

```
import { FundingSDK } from './packages/funding-sdk'; // Adjust path

async function main() {
  const sdk = new FundingSDK({ network: 'testnet', daoContractId: 'your-dao.testnet' });
  await sdk.init();

  const proposal = {
    description: 'Funding for hub event',
    amount: 1000000000000000000000000, // 1 NEAR
    recipient: 'recipient.testnet'
  };

  const txHash = await sdk.submitProposal(proposal);
  console.log(`Proposal submitted! Tx: ${txHash}`);
}

main();
```


Run with `ts-node your-script.ts`. It prompts wallet signing and submits to the DAO.
